# Paradata: War of 1812

*For Module 2 I decided to sonify data from the War of 1812. My model did not turn out how I intended so therefore I decided to search for data to then sonify. I intended to recreate the data in a way that was unique, original and showcased the data digitally in a new way.*

I started by searching for the battle locations online and created a list of the data. ([For precise information about what to search please see Module2/Notes/ProcessNotes](https://github.com/trinaetmanskie/Module2/blob/master/Notes/ProcessNotes.md)).  I was interested in seeing what I could do with the data and how it would translate into music. Once I collected the data I changed the DSM coordinates of the longitude and latitude into decimal degrees (DSM, is 41°24’12.2”N). In order to sonify data, it all needs to be in a decimal format. I then took this data and input it into Music Algorithms (an online website that translate data in music). I had to adjust the input, duration and mapping algorithms multiple times (please refer to process notes for more information) in order to get the final piece of data. 

While I did this, I was considerably changing the data. By changing the data I mean that I was no longer referring to these coordinates as battle locations but rather just decimals. Although it still contains the same information I was changing the meaning. I was considering David J. Gunkel’s discussion within his essay while I was doing this. Gunkel discusses the way that manipulating and recreating ““challenges the original understanding and private of originality” (Gunkel). Is this piece still considered to be original? I also questioned if this piece was just as meaningful as reading about these dates in a book or on a museum sign? Gunkel continues to discuss the art of recombinant rock and roll and how “the mashup manipulates and intervenes in the original” (Gunkel 496). I think that what I have done is very similar to this. I have intervened and changed the data by creating something new out of it. I no longer have a list of dates but rather a piano soundtrack. Reading this quote I was asking, are we manipulating the original and intervening with its message or we are intervening with to manipulate its message? I think we are able to recognize that sometimes we are changing the original and recreating something without losing the sentiment, and sometimes it creates a new meaning.

Gunkel continues on in his essay to finish with the sentiment that “reproduction precedes originality” (Gunkel 503). I think this is often the opposite of what many critics or historians may say. I think that people are often *obsessed* with the idea of originality. Consider this, would you travel to Paris to view a replica of the Mona Lisa? Probably not. But you may go to the local museum to see it...or even the flea market. I am not suggesting that I think one way or the other but I do think that this concept is something we may be moving towards. Thinking about the musical reproduction of the battle locations, I think we can consider the list of locations and the song as two separate objects. If they were located side by side within a museum I would think of them as two very different pieces. **But they contain the same data.** 

The important part of reproducing this piece is to physically hear the sound of the war. Tara Copplestone discuss photo-manipulation in her blog post, she says “Photo-manipulation (altering contrast, cropping, adjusting colour specs etc) has been widely used in archaeological processes as a way to clear-up, overlay, highlight etc certain elements.” When we sonify data we are manipulating the data to highlight certain elements. With this data, I have highlighted the battle locations from the war of 1812. 

After looking at my music creation I was struck by the quote from Sam Jacob, "Conservation is often misunderstood as a practice concerned with the past." Going through this course and many other courses history can be seem as something that is merely done. But as technology advances we are able to create and ultimately manipulate as much of this past as we want but the same can be done with the present. When I recreated this data of the battle locations, I was not changing the past but rather altering the present. I created a piece of work from this moment using elements of the past. The "FX" portion added to the song near the end represents elements of the present and futuristic music elements. It was a way to combine the past and present, *simultaneously*.

# Final Data
This is the exact information that needs to be entered into [Music Algorithms](http://musicalgorithms.org/3.2/#play) in order to reproduce the same music that I have created using the data. This section below is just the data that needs to be entered and where to enter it. For mores notes on HOW to create this please [click here](https://github.com/trinaetmanskie/Module2/blob/master/Notes/ProcessNotes.md).

In this file ([Module2/Notes/ProcessNotes](https://github.com/trinaetmanskie/Module2/tree/master/Notes)), there are screenshots with all the information in the proper sections. I have written in here but the images were easier to follow along. This data is all the information that soeone would need to inpuot into each section to get the exact same outcome that I did.
