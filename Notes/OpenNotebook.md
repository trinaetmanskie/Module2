# Remixing History
***

### Topic Models
Document remized as distrubtions of words 
graphing changes in topics using metadata and comparing 
visualiations tend to be network graphs or histograms 

Remixing John Adam's Mind
- Mashing up music with events (i.e bass sound when he goes to dinner)

### Ideas
Battle of 1812 - images from war or location based on sound 

***Sonification***
- Using Sketchfab to create music
Point of remixing history as a way to remix history - different than we write an essay 
-ties us to the agenda of public history 

***Twitterbots***
-Glitch.com
 - a way to remix code
 - i.e Create a Twitterbot which is a museum - collects 3D models and tweets 
 
 - *Generative Grammars*
 
 - ***Recurrent Neural Networks***
 
-  3D Scene Mash-ups
 
 - 3D File Mash-Up 
-> MeshMixer and Mesh lab
  
             *What happens when I mix together two 3D models?*
             
Look at Smithsonian and other places for creative commons pieces

> *Authority, aura and authorship*

**DON'T DO THIS TO YOUR ONLY COPY OF YOUR OBJECT!!**

# Lecture Feb-12-2018

Talk about Feedback: Active listening and attention in lectures, consciously make an effort to tie what you are seeing, 
doing with things in lecture, readings and class discussions #RADICALTRANSPARENCY

- Take very detailed notes
- Paradata document can include this information as well
- Meaningful engagement
- Build discussion into paradata document 
- Remember this is a *team effort*, you can always ask for help
- How and why is this information meaningful
- DETAILED: i.e what are you error messages? 

**Mesh Mixer**

-Blends two models togehter (Mesh Mixer is better than Mesh Lab)

- *You don't need to reinvent the wheel* 
- You can take two models from SketchFab and put them together 

## Museums and Reproductions 

Long standing practice of replications in the museum world 
- museums & caster replicas

Cast Courts, Great Exhibitions 1855 - prior to world fairs

1942, Mussolini - World's fair (uh during WW2 so bad call)
- filled with facist buildings (Basically EPCOT for facism)
Museo della Civilta' Romana (replicas - purposely) 

Resoration with reputation of cast moldings 
## Problems for museums
- will they allow models and modeling?
- will they allow data to be downloaded?
- will they allow data to be remixed?
- will they charge a fee?
